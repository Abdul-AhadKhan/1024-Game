# 1024-Game
In this game there are two numbers initially present in a grid and a new number is generated everytime with a movement in the grid. 
With every movement, the numbers which are similar and are adjacent are added (if the direction of the movement is similar to the position of the numbers), in this way, the numbers in the grid are reduced. 
The player wins the game if 1024 is generated in the grid by the additions of the similar numbers. 
The player losses if the grid is full and there are no adjacent entries similar.
